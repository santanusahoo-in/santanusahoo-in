# Santanu Sahoo ‚Äì Data Analyst & AI Enthusiast

#### Welcome to my portfolio!  
## About Me

I‚Äôm Santanu Sahoo, an aspiring Data Analyst and AI enthusiast currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from Swami Vivekanand University, Kolkata. My curiosity for data-driven problem-solving drives me to blend Python, SQL, Power BI, and Generative AI to uncover insights that make real-world impact.

I began my journey with a diploma in Electrical Engineering, but soon realized that data‚Äîlike electricity‚Äîpowers everything. Since then, I‚Äôve been channeling that spark into analytical storytelling, automation, and smart dashboards.

## What I do best:
- Turning raw data into interactive dashboards using Power BI & Excel
- Writing efficient SQL queries for deep insights
- Automating and cleaning data with Python (Pandas)
- Exploring AI tools for smarter analysis and visualization
